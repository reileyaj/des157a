        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
    <p>	I am updating studio 1, Mad Libs 2.0, to feature better UI/UX form practices and improve the visual design.</p>
    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>	I plan to focus the majority of my time and effort on improving the UI. Iâ€™ll do this by chunking the different input fields into 2-3 different cards that the user will automatically scroll to after confirming their last inputs. For the visual design, I plan to add a frosting texture to the background, make the input fields appear as birthday candles or confetti, and make the pop-up at the end appear more like a birthday card. I think all this will help associate the look of the site with the theme of the Mad Libs, which is to generate a birthday card. While reconfiguring the CSS, I also plan to make the design responsive. </p>
    <h2>Expert Feedback</h2>
    <p>	While usability testing, I plan to test with the design tutor, a non-design friend and family member who is unfamiliar with the project. That way I can get a more informed opinion from the tutor, and observe a more organic experience from my friend and family member. This way I can identify issues that the average user might have, rather than someone that's already familiar with the ins and outs of good and bad form design. Although the visual design is not my main focus, I plan to also run it by the design tutor and a professor. </p>
