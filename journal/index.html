                    This is the initial image I chose, since I think it has the most interesting lighting and movement. This image is also interesting to me, because it was from a recent rave where I got to see Zhu, who’s been on my bucket list for a while. My collection is rave-related, so this photo fits right in. It tells a story about different events I’ve gone to and some fun moments I’ve experienced with some of my best friends.

                    I asked Maaya to review my image, and they pointed out a couple things. They thought the image was from a concert/music event, which is correct. They pointed out that the colors add a lot of visual interest to the image, as well as the subjects’ arm placements, which draw lines towards the faces. They pointed out that the most mysterious parts of the image feature where it’s taken, and for what event.

                <h2>Visual Thinking Strategies Research</h2>
                <p>
                    This quarter, I’m taking an ethnography and design class (DES 126, if you’re interested). I noticed a lot of overlap with the ideas presented in that class and what was presented in <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">the article</a>: a lot of focus is put on slowing down, examining, research, and drawing conclusions based on observations. Outside of just images, this can help us become better designers as we better understand our audience, clients, and the affordances/limitations our designs have. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I found Daniel Roth’s <a href="https://www.danielroth.com/historical-models">Historical Models</a> site to use images in a dynamic way. The site displays different models of DR watches across the ‘90s, and presents the images in a slideshow. When hovering the mouse over the images, a circle with background blur will appear, and depending on where the mouse is, it will tell the user what they can do with the photo (either scroll to the next image or view more images of the watch). The animations of the images moving are clean and satisfying.

                <h2>Overlays Design Pattern Research</h2>
                <p>
                    Overlays demand user attention and prevent them from interacting with the parent screen until the overlay is dismissed or the task is completed. The article, <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows</a>, seeks to define correct (and incorrect) ways to use overlays. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’ve always looked at overlays and pop-ups similarly, and it makes sense that many other users do too. Being surprised by an overlay can lead to immediate dismissal, even if what it’s asking is important. To combat this, the article instructs to never have an overlay appear on its own; always have it triggered by a button, preferably labeled in a way that matches the title of the overlay. I was also interested to learn that there should be multiple ways of closing an overlay. Usually I click outside the overlay or on the ‘close’ or ‘x’ button, but some people use their keyboards to control their devices. This means making the escape key functional too is an important part of making the overlay accessible.

                <h2>Research from Design</h2>
                <p>	
                    I’m sure we’ve all stumbled across forms that are woefully designed. Poorly put together forms are all around us: in the checkout section of online stores, in the sign-up phase for apps, and on voluntary surveys. This article, <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best Practices for Form Design</a>, seeks to give us web designers guidelines to minimize pain points in our forms and provide the best user experience possible (which also reduces the chances of the form being abandoned!)
                </p>
                <p>
                    I already was familiar with some of the tactics used, such as chunking. Clearly indicating how many steps there are to the user, as well as what each step is (such as Shipping Address, Payment Information, and Order Confirmation for an online purchase) helps users get a sense of what they’ll need to fill out and their progress. Asking easy questions first, such as name and address, will get the user invested in the form before they may need to reach for something (like their credit card) to reference for future questions. I was surprised to learn that placeholder text can be harmful, because users sometimes forget the example and need to clear their answer to see it again. Leaving placeholder text visible underneath the input box can help reduce this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A form I found easy to fill out is the <a href="https://discord.com/register">Discord</a> registration form. It’s common for apps to ask for a lot of unnecessary information; Discord makes sure to minimize input fields. Outside of the obligatory username and password, it only asks for an optional display name, an email to verify the account, and a date of birth to verify that the user is 13 or older. They also make sure to define which fields are necessary with an asterisk.
